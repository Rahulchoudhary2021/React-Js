>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>......React Js ERROR File..........?????????

1)***Adjacent Error*** JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. 
Did you want a JSX fragment <>...</>{
"message": "JSX expressions must have one parent element.",
	}
Ans.. When you return 2 tag without using fregments...because App.js
 does not return two element at same time {React.create element}

 2)JSX main  3 rules's?
 sol. 1>Everytag has closing tag
      2>class name is reserved in js so we use className
	  3>and all tag are enclosed in single parent tag
